To build on Linux:
1) download and extract lame sources

3) change dir to encode2mp3/build/
4) generate Makefile by executing 'cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..'
5) execute make
6) start encoding by executing './encode2mp3 ../wave'

To build on Windows under Cygwin:
1) install Cygwin with make and gcc-g++ packages
2) download and extract lame sources
3) open lame-3.100/include/libmp3lame.sym and remove "lame_init_old" line
4) build lame by executing './configure && make' (frontend rule will fail)
5) copy lame-3.100/include/lame.h to encode2mp3/includes/lame/
6) copy lame-3.100/libmp3lame/.libs/libmp3lame.a to encode2mp3/libs/
7) change dir to encode2mp3/build/
8) generate Makefile by executing 'cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..'
9) execute 'make'
10)start encoding by executing './encode2mp3 ../wave'
